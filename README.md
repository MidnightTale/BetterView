## Description

BetterView is a high-performance Paper plugin and Fabric mod for Minecraft servers. It extends the normal view distance
without sacrificing server performance using asynchronous player processing, direct chunk reading from disk, and
caching of chunk data.

## Features

- Asynchronous fast player ticking on networking threads
- Reads chunks directly from disk without loading them
- Optimized chunk state tracking and chunk iteration
- Configurable chunk data caching for fast access
- Configurable limitations for chunk sending and chunk generation
- Per-dimension configuration options
- Support for integrated or dedicated fabric servers
- Lightweight anti-xray support for extended chunks

<summary><strong>Example: Loading speed for a view distance of 127 chunks</strong></summary>

The screenshot below was taken at `0 2250 0` in the end dimension with a view distance of 127 chunks
(with fog disabled). On an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, all visible chunks were transmitted to the client in about
12 seconds after having joined the server with a cold cache and in about 9 seconds with a warm cache.

On fabric, this mod depends on [Moonrise](https://github.com/Tuinity/Moonrise) to work.

## Usage

On Paper servers, place the jar file in your `plugins` directory and restart your server. On Fabric servers/clients,
place the jar file in your `mods` directory and restart your server or client. By default, BetterView will configure a
view distance of 32 chunks for each dimension.

### Configuration

On the first start, this plugin will automatically create a configuration file. If using Paper it will be created at
`plugins/BetterView/config.yml`, if using Fabric it will be created as `betterview.yml` inside your world directory
(e.g. `world` for dedicated servers). In there, you are able to configure the following options:

- `config-version`: Don't touch this
- `integrated-server-render-distance`: Only relevant for singleplayer worlds, this allows replacing the render distance
  of the integrated server as BetterView would otherwise have no effect (default: `-1`, disabled)
- `global`:
    - `enabled`: Whether to enable or disable the entire plugin/mod (default: `true`)
    - `chunk-generation-limit`: How many new chunks can be generated globally in one tick (default: `3`)
    - `chunk-send-limit`: The maximum amount of chunks sent to a player in a tick (default: `3`)
- `dimensions`:
    - `<dimension>` (e.g. `minecraft:overworld`):
        - `enabled`: Whether to enable or disable the plugin/mod for this dimension (default: `true`)
        - `chunk-generation-limit`: How many new chunks can be generated for this level in one tick (default: `2`)
        - `chunk-queue-size`: How many chunks can be queued per player at once (default: `16`)
        - `view-distance`: The maximum extended view distance for this dimension (default: `32`)
        - `cache-duration`: The cache duration for how long extended chunks should be kept in memory (default: `PT5M`,
          5 minutes)
        - `anti-xray`:
            - `enabled`: Whether anti-xray will be enabled or disabled in this world (default: `false`)
            - `engine-mode`: Engine modes of anti-xray, either `HIDE`, `OBFUSCATE`, or `OBFUSCATE_LAYER`
              (default: `HIDE`)
            - `hidden-blocks`: The list of blocks to hide/obfuscate (default: all ores and
              all base blocks of dimensions)

Feel free to play around with the chunk generations and chunk sending limits for
an optimal experience on your server setup.

When using anti-xray, be aware that this plugin implements a lightweight version of anti-xray, which
doesn't check if a block is exposed to air or not. This means that every engine-mode other than `HIDE`
will probably not look very good.

Make sure to adjust the cache duration based on what you use your server for;
for e.g. static lobby servers, you can use a longer cache duration than for dynamic SMP servers.
If the cache duration is too high, chunks will display outdated content after e.g. a rejoin.

## Building

1. Clone the project (`git clone https://github.com/MinceraftMC/BetterView.git`)
2. Go to the cloned directory (`cd BetterView`)
3. Build the jar files (`./gradlew build` on Linux/MacOS, just `gradlew build` on Windows)

The jar files can be found in the `build` → `libs` directory.

### Contributing

If you want to contribute to BetterView, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request. Please make sure to
follow the code style and conventions used in the project. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask in
our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zC8xjtSPKC).

You can test your changes by running `./gradlew :paper:runServer` or
`./gradlew :fabric:prodServer`/`./gradlew :fabric:prodClient` respectively. This will start a local server with the
compiled plugin or mod automatically installed, ready for debugging in your IDE.
